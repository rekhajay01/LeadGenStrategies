This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for healthy snacks and natural food ingredients, as raisins are considered a rich source of vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants. With a growing health-conscious consumer base, particularly in regions like North America and Europe, the preference for raisins as a nutrient-dense snack has risen sharply. Moreover, the expanding food processing industry is using raisins in various products, such as baked goods, cereals, and snacks, which further drives market demand. The trend towards plant-based and clean-label foods also plays a significant role in the market's growth, as consumers increasingly seek natural and minimally processed food options. Additionally, the rising awareness about the health benefits of raisins, such as promoting digestive health, boosting immunity, and supporting heart health, is driving consumer preference. The growing trend of functional foods and the incorporation of raisins into health supplements is likely to contribute to the expansion of the market over the forecast period.
